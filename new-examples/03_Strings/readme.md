# Strings

In the first part you see that strings can be written in single and double quotes </br>

In the second part you see how string interpolation works </br>
It allows to include constants to string but not expressions yet

In the third part you see how multiline text can be created </br>
Multiple strings are passed to `` ` `` function as arguments
Also here you can see that `=` expression has a little cheat </br>
You can write no parentheses or tabs but it works </br>
The secret is that this expression evaluates the first its argument as expression and the rest arguments as this expression's arguments </br>
As you will see later many other operators has the same cheat
