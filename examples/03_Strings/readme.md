# Strings

In the first part you see that strings can be written in single and double quotes </br>

In the second part you see how string interpolation works. It allows to include constants to string but not expressions yet

In the third part you see how multiline text can be created. Multiple strings are passed to `` ` `` function as arguments

Also here you can see that `=` expression has a little cheat. You can write no parentheses or tabs but it works. The secret is that this expression translates the first its argument as expression and the rest arguments as this expression's arguments. As you will see later many other operators has the same cheat
