# Sova

<i>Sova</i> is an experimental functional programming language based on:

-   Lisp syntax
-   Python indentation
-   Javascript platform

**WARNING: _This is just proof of concept - it's not production ready at all_**

## Motivation

Every programming language has a lot of boilerplate in it's syntax. The purpose of this project is to create a programming language with minimalistic and very clean syntax.

## Examples

-   [Console Application](/example/console)
-   [Express Application](/example/express)
-   [React Application](/example/react)
-   [React Native Application](/example/react-native)

## Next steps

Need to add syntax for:

-   try catch
-   class declaration and instantiation
-   string right parsing and string interpolation
-   comments

Add tests for:

-   parser
-   translator
