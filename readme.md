# Una

<i>Una</i> is an experimental functional programming language that took the best parts from Javascript, Lisp and Python. It's not fully ready for production yet but you can already use it.

## Features:

<ul>
<li>Una has very simple syntax based on symmetries</li>
<li>Una is being transpiled to JavaScript. So you can start using it in your JavaScript project right now</li>
<li>Una is fully compatible with JavaScript. You can import Una from JavaScript and JavaScript from Una.</li>
</ul>

**If you liked this project, please support us with a star** ðŸŒŸ

## Installation

To use <i>Una</i> in your project you need to install babel plugin:

```
npm i --save-dev babel-plugin-una-language
```

or

```
yarn add -D babel-plugin-una-language
```

then add the plugin to your babel config:

```
plugins: ['una-language']
```

TODO: write here about adding extension option to babel, babel-node etc.

## Documentation

### Application order

### Assignment

```
= name "John"
= number 1
```

### Symmetries

Una has three symmetries: synchronous computations symmetry, asynchronous computation symmetry and module symmetry.

#### Synchronous computation symmetry

##### ->

##### <-

Write here about simple assignment
Write here about evaluation of multiple lines

#### Asynchronous computation symmetry

##### -->

##### <--

Write here about await
Write here about await of multiple lines (I think not to do it like Promise.all but just as sync symmetry)

#### Module symmetry

##### =->

##### <-=

### Arithmetical operators

Write here about +, - (unary and nary), \*, /, %

### Logical operators

Write here about &, |, !

### Comparison operators

Write here about ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

### Conditional operator

```
? (> a 1) "Greater" "Less"
```

#### Pattern matching

```
<- count
    ? (= value 0) 1
    ? (= value 1) 2
    ? (< value 10) 3
    4
```

### Collections

## Future work

What else has to be done:

<ul>
<li>Exception handling</li>
<li>Strings and escaping</li>
<li>Strings interpolation</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code syntax highlighting plugin</li>
</ul>
